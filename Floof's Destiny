	<h1>The Story of Joshua the Furry</h1>
	<div class="content" id="story">
		Chapter 1, The Beginning of a Long Tail.<br><br>
		Joshua, grew up as a misfit, who didn’t fit into the world around him. His appearance is what made it hard for
		people to like him. He was bullied for having ears and a tail like a dog. A creature that went extinct billions of
		years ago. The story of how Joshua or as people call him “Stinky”, was even born into such a cruel world. A lot of
		the story is unknown and lost in time but somewhere back trillions of years ago, in the era of what people call
		humans, he was a human. His dream was to develop a formula for immortality. He successfully developed a formula. How
		so, you ask? He was searching in the caves for bacteria that could possibly expand life longevity. He mixed this
		with some genes from other species, which sort of sterilized the weird and unsettling bacteria. Then he added some
		other chemicals which then he tested the formula in a simulation he’s been creating for years. It seemed as if it
		would be a successful transformation. He got excited and injected it into himself with no further consideration. He
		waits, but nothing has changed. He takes a blood sample and looks further into whether or not his body’s biology has
		changed on a molecular level. He could not check if it changed on an atomic level, as such technology has not been
		perfected yet. He looks into it and he finds.. Nothing has changed. He thinks, “I must need time to adjust.” He
		packs up his things and heads home. His mom, named Velma, is a smart woman, who has mastered the dark arts
		thoroughly and can cast any spell. He drives home, and he asks his mom.. “Do you have a spell for
		immortality?”.<br><br>

		She pauses for a second, and says.. “The only way someone can directly obtain immortality is from finding some sort
		of mutated bacteria from some place for example caves, mountains, or even another planet. No one has ever found
		anything, and even so, it may have negative effects on your body’s biology or transform you into another creature
		altogether.” He then goes to his room, and falls asleep.. Only to wake up to the sound of banging on his door. He
		tries to get up, but feels very intimidated and quite ill by something nearby, or on him..? He struggles to get up,
		and he then has a very excruciating headache, that doesn’t stop pounding. He feels something crawling from his skin,
		as if there is bugs under his hair, and they are puncturing his scalp to get out. He screams, but no one can hear
		him. It’s as if, he’s trapped somewhere remotely. No sound ever comes out of his mouth. No one ever comes to check
		on him. And he reads his clock, it is glitching, as if time is passing. He then looks at his window and its
		switching from day to night to day to night extremely quickly. He then looks at the door, and sees himself, come and
		go. More people come and go, unknown people. The world fills up. Technology is advancing and decelerating at the
		same time. He is then knocked out cold by what feels a puncture in his brain..
